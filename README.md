We want to leave this event as an open hackathon to promote creativity and learning. Above is a list of technologies that Skip uses that you may use as a guideline for possible technologies to use for your project. You may also use any other technology you wish. In terms of what to build we aren't looking for anything too specific, but just something that you can build in 8 hours here that will impress us. Consider using an api like Google Places Api - if you are a FE/Mobile dev you could build a data visualization app, or if you are BE then perhaps Path optimization or some kind of interesting data manipulation for restaurants in Sao Paulo. Or if you want to make a project about the World Cup or anything else that's fine too. Feel free to work alone with existing data or apis, or in groups where a Java dev can build an API for a mobile or FE dev, devops can build a CICD pipeline for the project and the data engineer can design a solution to make sure the application would scale to millions of users. 


We ask that you provide documentation for your project in the form of system diagrams, mockups, screenshots and justifications for the technology you choose to use. Please do not work on any existing personal projects you may have, we want to see what you can do today.


We are aware that we will talk to some of you early on before you have much chance to work on your projects, do not worry. The first interview will be more about you and your experience, we will be looking at completed projects later on and we may discuss them in your follow up interview at the end of the day as well. Please just ensure that your project is something we can look at later on with proper documentation, screenshots, examples, or instructions.
